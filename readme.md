# TODO
* life movement
* animation of "legs" that kick


// It seems ALL objects can calculate their own locations, velocity and acceleration till a collision occurs.
// All objects can use this information to draw itself.
// When a collision occurs, location, velocity and acceleration have to be calculated and recorded

// Walls need to send linear waves

// every time Life kicks, it creates a wave
// waves die out when their color fades to zero
