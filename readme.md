# Rules
* every time Life kicks or bumps a wall, it creates a wave
* waves die out when their color fades to zero

# TODO:
* animation of "legs" that kick

# Philosophogistics
* It seems ALL objects can calculate their own locations, velocity and acceleration till a collision occurs
* When a collision occurs, location, velocity and acceleration have to be calculated and recorded
